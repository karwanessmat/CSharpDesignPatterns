The Strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

C# Design Patterns


Participants
#
The classes and objects participating in this pattern include:

1-Strategy  (SortStrategy)
	-declares an interface common to all supported algorithms. Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy

2- ConcreteStrategy  (QuickSort, ShellSort, MergeSort)
	-implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface

3- Context  (SortedList)
	-is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object
	-maintains a reference to a Strategy object
	-may define an interface that lets Strategy access its data.
