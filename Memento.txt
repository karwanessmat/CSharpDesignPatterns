Memento  (Memento)
 * stores internal state of the Originator object. The memento may store as much or as little of
 the originator's internal state as necessary at its originator's discretion.
 * protect against access by objects of other than the originator. Mementos have effectively 
 two interfaces. Caretaker sees a narrow interface to the Memento -- it can only pass the memento to 
 the other objects. Originator, in contrast, sees a wide interface, one that lets it access all
 the data necessary to restore itself to its previous state. Ideally, only the originator that 
 produces the memento would be permitted to access the memento's internal state.


 Originator  (SalesProspect)
 * creates a memento containing a snapshot of its current internal state.
 * uses the memento to restore its internal state

 Caretaker  (Caretaker)
 * is responsible for the memento's safekeeping
 * never operates on or examines the contents of a memento.
