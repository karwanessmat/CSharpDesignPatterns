Participants
The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Component   (LibraryItem)
defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.

ConcreteComponent   (Book, Video)
defines an object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.

Decorator   (Decorator)
maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface.

ConcreteDecorator   (Borrowable)
adds responsibilities to the component.
